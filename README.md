# Braxton Mills Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This modern, responsive site showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Full Stack Developer. Built with cutting-edge technologies, it offers an engaging and interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- React Icons
- React Scroll

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Next.js app directory
- `components/`: React components for each section
- `public/`: Static assets

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
2. **pnpm**: Version 9.9.0 or higher, installed via Corepack.
   1. *Note: This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. If you don't have it installed, you can use npm or yarn instead.*
   2. *If you haven't already, I'd highly recommend switching to pnpm for faster installs, disk space savings, and superior monorepo support over npm.*

## Enable Corepack & Install pnpm

If you haven't already, enable Corepack (which is included with Node.js 16.10 and later) by running:

```console
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.9.0 --activate
```
